With all the powerful built-in tools, a small business owner can save money (using self-service), reduce waste (with instant promotions) and receive mobile orders directly into his point-of-sale.  The marketing tools are easy to use, with simple drag-and-drop user interfaces.  The business can deploy multiple stations placed directly in the kitchen or warehouse for order-monitoring and to print order tickets at the right place.  Using the Chalkboards point-of-sale, businesses can sell more, save more and connect more, and most importantly, use technology like the big corporations, and still maintain his individuality.</p>
